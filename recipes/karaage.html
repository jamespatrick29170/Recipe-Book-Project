        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>Chicken karaage is first referenced in the late 17th century. The dish was popularized the
            1930's as "Chinese-style" food. Karaage most typically refers to chicken, which has been
            diced into small chunks, marinated and then dredged in cornstarch/flour before frying. Chicken
            karaage is so popular nowadays that it's sold in conbinis like 7-Eleven and Lawson.
        </p>
        <p>Karaage when done properly should come out incredibly crispy on the outside and still 
            exceptionally juicy on the inside. Marinated for up to 48 hours in a combination of soy sauce,
            mirin, worcestershire and various spices it's also extremely flavorful. You can change the meat
            used or play with the marinade levels to your hearts content.
