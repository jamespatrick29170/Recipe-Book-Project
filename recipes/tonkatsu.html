        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>In Japan, tonkatsu is considered one of "The Three Great Yoshoku" alongside curry rice and 
            and korokke (similar to a croquette). Much like other Yoshoku dishes, tonkatsu has it's roots
            in European cuisine and was developed during the Meiji era. Unlike curry which was derived from
            British recipes, Tonkatsu finds it's origin in <em>côtelette de veau</em> a french dish of veal 
            cutlet, breaded and panfried in butter.
        </p>
        <p>Dredged in light flour, then egg, then panko, tonkatsu manages to retain incredible juiciness while
            also having a delightful crunch. Most commonly it's thin sliced and accompanied by rice or cabbage as 
            well as <em>katsu sauce</em>. Katsu sauce is a thick worcestershire like sauce comparable to BBQ sauce.
            Often times Japanese curry and tonkatsu are combined to create Katsu curry.
