        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
        <p>Introduced in the late 1800's to Japan by the British Navy, curry was quickly adopted and 
            adapted by the Japanese. By 1905 Japanese curry powder was being produced commercially and by
            1920 the predecessors of S&B and House began selling curry powder. Curry has gained popularity
            continuously since then in Japan, with many prefectures as well as military units having their
            own unique recipes.
        </p>
        <p>Japanese curry is noticeably more muted and subtle than standard Indian curry. It is also 
            much sweeter in many cases due to the Japanese integrating sweet fruits like apples into their
            recipes. Overall the flavor of Japanese curry is very akin to a well spiced stew, which goes well
            when paired with rice to absorb the gravy.
