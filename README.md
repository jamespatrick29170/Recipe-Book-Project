# Recipe-Book-Project
This website will be a recipe book. This is being done as part of TheOdinProject HTML curricula. The three recipes I will include are: Japanese Curry, Karaage Chicken and Tonkatsu. This project will show
a command of basic HTML such as lists, links, formatting and multipage website development.
